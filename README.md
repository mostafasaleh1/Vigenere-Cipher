# Vigenere Cipher
This is a vigenere cipher windows forms application built with C#. It's used for both encryption and decryption of text using a key.

## What is Vigenere Cipher?
The Vigenere cipher is a classical encryption technique that provides a method of encrypting and decrypting messages. It is a substitution cipher that uses a keyword or phrase to determine the shifting of letters in the plaintext.

## Vigenere Cipher Algorithm:
The Vigenere cipher builds upon the concept of the Caesar cipher, which involves shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed amount. However, instead of using a single shift value, the Vigenere cipher employs a keyword to determine multiple shift values for each letter in the plaintext.
